Step by Step Guide:


Install Python (if not installed yet)
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads
Download the latest version for Windows.

IMPORTANT: During installation, check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” before clicking Install.


What to run in the Terminal for Python + Salesforce Integration:

1. pip install simple-salesforce

2. B. Get Your Salesforce Credentials
You’ll need the following from Salesforce (from a Developer Org or Sandbox):

Parameter	
Username: youremail@myorg.com.dev
Password: YourPassword123
Security Token: 
Domain: 'test' 

3. Build a Web Page with Python (using Flask)
Install Flask: pip install Flask


4. Run the Flask App
Now, go to your terminal and run the Flask app:

python app.py


5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, and you should see your app with Salesforce data displayed on the page.


Python Anywhere:

1. Upload Your Project Files Directly (If Not Using GitHub)
If you’re not using GitHub, you can upload your files directly from VS Code to PythonAnywhere:

Go to the Files tab in PythonAnywhere.

Click the Upload a file button to upload the files from your local project (flask_app.py, templates/, static/, etc.) to the appropriate directory (/home/softcodeDev/mysite/).

2. Install Dependencies on PythonAnywhere
(e.g., Flask, simple_salesforce), you’ll need to install them in PythonAnywhere’s virtual environment.

3. Open a Bash Console in PythonAnywhere.

Navigate to your project directory:

cd /home/softcodeDev/mysite

Install your app’s dependencies (make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your project, or you can create it with:

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install simple_salesforce


4. Configure the Web App. Now, let’s link the app to the web interface on PythonAnywhere.

In the PythonAnywhere Dashboard, go to the Web tab.


In the WSGI configuration file section, click to edit the file (it should open in the editor).

Edit the WSGI configuration file to point to your flask_app.py:

import sys
import os

# Add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = '/home/softcodeDev/mysite'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)

# Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
os.environ['FLASK_APP'] = 'flask_app.py'

# Import the Flask app and assign to 'application'
from flask_app import app as application


5. Restart the Web App
After saving the changes to the WSGI configuration file:

Go back to the Web tab on PythonAnywhere.

Click the Reload button to restart your app.

6. Test Your App
Your Flask app should now be live at the URL E.g: https://softcodedev.pythonanywhere.com/. You can test it by navigating to this URL in your browser.

If everything is set up correctly, your app should be deployed and running smoothly!
